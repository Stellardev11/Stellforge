## What Makes StellForge Different?

**StellForge combines the best of GameFi and DeFi** - earn loyalty points through platform activity, participate in viral token launches, swap assets, and prepare for the SLF token generation event where **60% of all SLF tokens go to STAR holders**.

### 🌟 The STAR Points System

**STAR (Stellar Rewards)** is your loyalty score on StellForge. The more you participate, the more STAR you earn, and the more SLF tokens you'll receive at TGE.

**How to Earn STAR Points:**
- **Mint STAR**: Deposit 1 XLM → Get 10 STAR instantly (non-transferable)
- **Refer Friends**: Earn 5% of your referrals' STAR points
- **Join Airdrops**: Participate in token launches to earn bonus STAR
- **Complete Tasks**: Social tasks and platform activities reward additional STAR
- **Stay Active**: Regular engagement increases your STAR multiplier

**Why STAR Matters:**
- **TGE Allocation**: 60M SLF (60% of total supply) distributed to STAR holders
- **Fair Distribution**: Your share = Your STAR / Total STAR points
- **No Whales**: Points-based system prevents unfair concentration
- **Early Advantage**: Early adopters accumulate more STAR before TGE

**Example:**
- You deposit 100 XLM → Get 1,000 STAR
- Refer 5 friends who mint 50 XLM each → Get 125 bonus STAR (5% of 2,500)
- Join 3 airdrops → Get 300 bonus STAR
- **Total: 1,425 STAR points**
- At TGE: If total STAR = 1M, you receive (1,425/1,000,000) × 60M = **85,500 SLF tokens**

## Use Cases & Examples

### Example 1: New User - Maximizing STAR Before TGE

**Goal**: Accumulate as much STAR as possible before token generation.

**Strategy:**
1. **Initial mint**: Deposit 50 XLM → Get 500 STAR
2. **Referral campaign**: Share link, get 10 friends to mint 20 XLM each
   - Friends generate: 10 × 200 = 2,000 STAR
   - You earn: 5% × 2,000 = **100 bonus STAR**
3. **Join 5 airdrops**: Participate in token launches
   - Average 100 STAR per campaign = **500 bonus STAR**
4. **Social tasks**: Complete Twitter/Discord tasks
   - Earn **200 bonus STAR**

**Total STAR**: 500 + 100 + 500 + 200 = **1,300 STAR**

**Projected TGE allocation** (assuming 10M total STAR):
- Your share: 1,300 / 10,000,000 = 0.013%
- SLF received: 0.013% × 60M = **7,800 SLF tokens**

**Cost**: 50 XLM deposit (fully yours, withdraw anytime)

### Example 2: Token Creator - Viral Community Launch

**Scenario**: Launch a community token with built-in growth mechanics.

**Steps:**
1. **Create token**: Name, symbol, 10M supply
2. **Set allocation**:
   - 50% (5M) → Airdrop participants
   - 30% (3M) → DEX liquidity pool
   - 20% (2M) → Team (vested)
3. **Configure campaign**:
   - Duration: 7 days
   - Entry: Join + 1 STAR earned
   - Referral bonus: +5 entries per referral
4. **Launch campaign**: Share referral link
5. **Viral growth**:
   - Each participant gets unique referral link
   - Incentivized to share (more entries = more tokens)
   - Leaderboard shows top referrers
6. **Auto-launch**: Campaign ends → DEX launches automatically
7. **Distribution**: Participants claim tokens based on entries

**Result**:
- 1,000+ engaged community members
- High-quality token holders (earned, not bought)
- Immediate DEX liquidity
- Active social media presence

**Participant perspective**:
- Joined airdrop → Got 1 entry (base)
- Referred 20 friends → Got 100 bonus entries
- Total entries: 101
- Token share: 101 / 50,000 total = 0.202%
- Tokens received: 0.202% × 5M = **10,100 tokens**
